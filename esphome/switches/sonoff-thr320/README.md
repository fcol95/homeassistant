# Sonoff TH Origin 20A THR320 Smart Switch ESPHome Config
Create a new yaml file for each device by copying "switch-sonoff-thr320-example.yaml".
The keys and passwords to replace can be auto-generated by HA esphome builder, by created new device, esp32, and name it accordingly.
Then you can copy the example in their and just keep the generated keys.

You can also set the min/max/step/default temperature values of the climate component.

Right now, the only template available is for a DS18B20 sensor connected with a custom harness.

Future template working with the Sonoff official WTS01 waterproof temperature sensor could be possible once this PR is closed:

## References
This config is a mix between the THR316 and THR320D esphome configs and has been inspired by:
- https://devices.esphome.io/devices/Sonoff-THR316
- https://devices.esphome.io/devices/Sonoff-THR320D.
- https://templates.blakadder.com/sonoff_THR320.html.
The THR320 has the same main relay as the THR320D, but not the screen, only the three LEDs and switch as the THR316.

It has been modified to be use with subsitutions and templates for ease of duplication and versionning.
