# Sonoff TH Origin 20A THR320 Smart Switch ESPHome Config
Create a new yaml file for each device by copying:
- "switch-sonoff-thr320-ths01.yaml" for the version with the ambient air and humidity sensor.
- "switch-sonoff-thr320-wts01.yaml" for the version with waterproof sensor.

The keys and passwords to replace can be auto-generated by HA esphome builder, by created new device, esp8266, and name it accordingly.
Then you can copy the example in their and just keep the generated keys.
