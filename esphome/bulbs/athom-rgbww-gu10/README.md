# Athom RGBWW GU10 Smart Bulb - ESPHome preflashed
Create a new yaml file for each device by copying "light-athom-gu10-example.yaml".
The keys and passwords to replace can be auto-generated by HA esphome builder, by created new device, esp8266, and name it accordingly.
Then you can copy the example in their and just keep the generated keys.
You can also set the recovery state of the light by device with light_restore_mode.
